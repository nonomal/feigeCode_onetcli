# Release Distribution

This document records the production distribution contract for app updates and
extension marketplace downloads.

## Main App Releases

The main application release is split into two GitHub Actions workflows:

1. `.github/workflows/release.yml` builds `main`, packages platform assets,
   creates `sha256sums.txt`, writes `release-metadata`, and publishes the
   GitHub Release.
2. `.github/workflows/upload-r2.yml` runs after the `Release` workflow completes
   successfully, downloads the GitHub Release assets, generates
   `updates/latest.json`, and uploads the app assets plus update manifest to R2.

The release workflow does not upload to R2 directly. This keeps GitHub Release
creation as the first successful publication point and makes R2 upload
retryable through `workflow_dispatch` with a release tag.

The R2 workflow uploads:

```text
releases/<tag>/<asset>
updates/latest.json
```

`updates/latest.json` contains target-triple download URLs and sha256 values:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "version": "0.4.8",
  "release_page_url": "https://<public-base>/releases/v0.4.8/",
  "downloads": {
    "aarch64-apple-darwin": "https://<public-base>/releases/v0.4.8/onetcli-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz",
    "x86_64-apple-darwin": "https://<public-base>/releases/v0.4.8/onetcli-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz",
    "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu": "https://<public-base>/releases/v0.4.8/onetcli-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz",
    "x86_64-pc-windows-msvc": "https://<public-base>/releases/v0.4.8/onetcli-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip"
  },
  "fallback_downloads": {
    "aarch64-apple-darwin": "https://github.com/<org>/<repo>/releases/download/v0.4.8/onetcli-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz",
    "x86_64-apple-darwin": "https://github.com/<org>/<repo>/releases/download/v0.4.8/onetcli-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz",
    "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu": "https://github.com/<org>/<repo>/releases/download/v0.4.8/onetcli-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz",
    "x86_64-pc-windows-msvc": "https://github.com/<org>/<repo>/releases/download/v0.4.8/onetcli-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip"
  },
  "sha256s": {
    "aarch64-apple-darwin": "<sha256>",
    "x86_64-apple-darwin": "<sha256>",
    "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu": "<sha256>",
    "x86_64-pc-windows-msvc": "<sha256>"
  }
}
```

The client reads `ONETCLI_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` from the runtime environment first,
then from the build-time value injected by `build.rs`. When that value is
present, the update URL is derived as `<public-base>/updates/latest.json`.
`ONETCLI_UPDATE_URL` remains an explicit override for custom update endpoints.
When `fallback_downloads` or `fallback_download_url` is present, the update
dialog downloads from the R2/custom URL first and then retries the matching
GitHub fallback asset if the primary package download fails.

There is no hardcoded Cloudflare public base URL in production code. If neither
`ONETCLI_UPDATE_URL` nor `ONETCLI_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is provided, the client uses
GitHub Releases directly. With the default build, a configured R2/custom update
source is tried first and GitHub Releases are tried next when R2 is unavailable,
returns an invalid manifest, or is stale. The `github-distribution` feature uses
GitHub-only app updates and GitHub-only extension marketplace manifests.

## Extension Marketplace

This repository owns the marketplace consumption mechanism. The extension
repository owns extension package builds, the committed marketplace index, and
plugin manifest publication.

The default extension manifest source is resolved in this order:

1. Runtime `ONETCLI_EXTENSION_MANIFEST_URL`
2. Build-time `ONETCLI_EXTENSION_MANIFEST_URL`
3. `ONETCLI_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` plus `extensions/manifest.json`
4. GitHub Release asset fallback. The fallback URL is resolved from runtime
   `ONETCLI_EXTENSION_GITHUB_MANIFEST_URL`, then build-time
   `ONETCLI_EXTENSION_GITHUB_MANIFEST_URL`, then the built-in GitHub fallback.

The marketplace index is schema v2. It declares installable extension metadata
and the relative plugin manifest path only. It does not contain artifact lists,
primary package URLs, or fallback package URLs. The official extension
repository maintains this index directly as `manifest.json`; upload automation
publishes that file to `extensions/manifest.json`.

```json
{
  "schema_version": 2,
  "release_version": "2026.06",
  "extensions": [
    {
      "id": "duckdb",
      "kind": "database_driver",
      "name": "DuckDB",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "release_tag": "duckdb-v1.0.0",
      "description": "DuckDB embedded analytical database IPC driver",
      "file_extensions": [],
      "manifest": "duckdb/manifest.json"
    }
  ]
}
```

Each extension also publishes a plugin manifest. The plugin manifest is schema
v2 and declares installable artifacts only: file names, checksums, and the
per-entry release tag needed to locate matching GitHub Release assets. It does
not contain primary or fallback download URLs.

```json
{
  "schema_version": 2,
  "release_version": "duckdb-v1.0.0",
  "extensions": [
    {
      "id": "duckdb",
      "kind": "database_driver",
      "name": "DuckDB",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "release_tag": "duckdb-v1.0.0",
      "artifacts": {
        "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu": {
          "file": "duckdb-driver-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz",
          "sha256": "<sha256>"
        },
        "universal": {
          "file": "duckdb-driver-universal.tar.gz",
          "sha256": "<sha256>"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Artifact keys are selectors. The client tries the exact native target triple,
then an OS alias, then `universal`. Native IPC database drivers normally publish
target-triple artifacts. WASM and other platform-independent extensions should
publish a `universal` artifact.

The client loads the marketplace index first, then loads the selected entry's
plugin manifest. For R2, the plugin manifest is published at
`extensions/<id>/manifest.json`, and package URLs are resolved from that plugin
manifest directory using `<version>/<file>`. For example, `duckdb` version
`1.0.0` with file `duckdb-driver-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz` in
`https://onetcli.test.cn/extensions/duckdb/manifest.json` resolves to
`https://onetcli.test.cn/extensions/duckdb/1.0.0/duckdb-driver-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz`.

If the R2 plugin manifest is unavailable, the client derives a GitHub plugin
manifest fallback URL from the configured GitHub manifest base and the entry's
`release_tag`: `<github releases download base>/<release_tag>/extension-manifest.json`.
The client derives GitHub artifact fallback URLs from the same release tag plus
the selected artifact `file`.
Non-language extension packages require sha256 validation metadata before
installation.

## Required GitHub Configuration

Repository variables:

- `ONETCLI_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`: public Cloudflare/R2 base URL, for example
  `https://onetcli.test.cn`
- `ONETCLI_EXTENSION_GITHUB_MANIFEST_URL`: optional extension marketplace
  GitHub fallback manifest URL, usually pointing at the extension repository
  Release asset after extension publishing is split out.

Repository secrets for R2 upload:

- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`
- `CLOUDFLARE_R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `CLOUDFLARE_R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `CLOUDFLARE_R2_BUCKET`

The application build can omit `ONETCLI_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`; in that case the
client falls back to GitHub release and marketplace sources. The application
build can also omit `ONETCLI_EXTENSION_GITHUB_MANIFEST_URL`; in that case the
client uses the built-in GitHub marketplace fallback.
