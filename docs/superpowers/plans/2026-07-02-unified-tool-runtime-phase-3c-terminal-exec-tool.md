# Unified Tool Runtime Phase 3c Terminal Exec Tool Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Add a new `terminal.exec` tool that executes through an existing visible terminal session, while preserving the current structured SSH tools and all legacy aliases.

**Architecture:** Keep `ssh.exec` as the structured non-interactive SSH command tool. Add a separate terminal execution bridge backed by `terminal_view`/`PublicMcpRegistry` terminal sessions. The new tool writes the command into the live terminal PTY, submits it, and returns an observed output snapshot or submission status without pretending to have a structured exit code when the terminal cannot prove one.

**Tech Stack:** Rust 2024, `tool_runtime`, `public_mcp`, `terminal_view`, `ai_chat_view`, GPUI tests where needed.

## Tracking Status

Last updated: 2026-07-02

Current status: Provider and Agent/UI prompt/card checkpoints verified; manual app smoke not started.

Committed checkpoints:

| Commit | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| `95ed3e00 docs: add terminal exec tool migration plan` | Defines the additive `terminal.exec` plan and preserves existing SSH tools. |
| `f0777d07 feat(public_mcp): add terminal exec runtime contract` | Adds the Public MCP/runtime contract, registry support, descriptor, handler, and contract tests. |

Provider checkpoint:

| Area | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `crates/terminal` input bridge | Done | Adds `TerminalInputHandle` so non-UI adapters can write bytes into the existing backend input path. |
| Local PTY / SSH / serial backend input handles | Done | Each backend returns an input handle that forwards bytes to the same command channel used by terminal typing. |
| `terminal_view` Public MCP provider | Done | Registers `TerminalExecSessionHandle` for terminal sessions that expose an input handle. |
| Output/exit-code capture | Deferred | Provider returns `submitted_only` unless a reliable terminal completion/output-delta API exists. Do not fabricate exit codes. |
| Agent/UI prompt and tool card changes | Done | Prompt distinguishes visible terminal execution from structured SSH execution; tool and confirmation cards label `terminal_exec` as terminal execution. |
| Manual app smoke | Not started | Requires running the app with an SSH terminal tab and asking Agent to execute in the visible terminal. |

Verification completed for the provider checkpoint:

rtk cargo check -p ai_chat_view
```

Known warning:

```bash
block v0.1.6 future-incompat warning
```

Next handoff step:

Open an SSH terminal, ask Agent to run `df -h` in the terminal, and verify the command
appears in the terminal pane.

## Decision Record

The user explicitly wants the "terminal execution effect":

1. The command appears in the terminal like a user typed it.
2. The terminal pane shows the command output from the same session.
3. Existing structured command tools must remain available.

Therefore:

1. Do not mutate `ssh.exec` into a terminal-surface tool.
2. Keep `ssh.exec` / `ssh.remote_exec` / `ssh.command.*` as structured remote execution tools.
3. Add `terminal.exec` for live terminal execution.
4. Agent prompt should prefer `terminal.exec` only when the user asks for visible terminal execution, side-panel current terminal execution, or "like typing in the terminal".

## Tool Contract

Canonical id:

```text
terminal.exec
```

Input schema:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "target": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Active terminal resource id, label, or alias."
    },
    "command": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Command text to insert into the terminal."
    },
    "submit": {
      "type": "boolean",
      "default": true,
      "description": "When true, press Enter after inserting the command."
    },
    "wait_for_output": {
      "type": "boolean",
      "default": true,
      "description": "When true, wait for a bounded terminal output delta."
    },
    "timeout_ms": {
      "type": ["integer", "null"],
      "default": 60000
    }
  },
  "required": ["target", "command"]
}
```

Output schema shape:

```json
{
  "target": "terminal-ssh-prod-a",
  "command": "df -h",
  "submitted": true,
  "completion": "observed_output | shell_integration_exit | submitted_only | timed_out",
  "exit_code": null,
  "output": "...",
  "duration_ms": 1200
}
```

Rules:

1. `target` resolves only to `ResourceKind::Terminal`.
2. `command` must be sent to the terminal input unchanged.
3. `submit=true` appends Enter; `submit=false` stages the text without execution.
4. If shell integration can prove exit status, set `completion=shell_integration_exit` and include `exit_code`.
5. If shell integration is not available, return `observed_output`, `submitted_only`, or `timed_out`; do not invent `exit_code`.
6. Permission risk is `High` and `open_world=true`.

## Task 1: Contract Tests For `terminal.exec`

- [x] **Step 1: Add failing registry/list test**

Create `crates/public_mcp/tests/terminal_exec.rs` with a fake terminal execution handle. Assert:

```rust
assert!(names.contains(&"terminal.exec".to_string()));
```

Expected red result: `terminal.exec` is not registered.

- [x] **Step 2: Add failing descriptor test**

Assert:

```rust
assert_eq!(json!(["target", "command"]), tool.input_schema["required"]);
assert_eq!("string", tool.input_schema["properties"]["target"]["type"]);
assert_eq!("string", tool.input_schema["properties"]["command"]["type"]);
assert_eq!(false, tool.annotations.read_only);
assert_eq!(true, tool.annotations.open_world);
```

Expected red result: descriptor does not exist.

- [x] **Step 3: Add failing execution test**

Call:

```json
{
  "target": "terminal-1",
  "command": "df -h",
  "submit": true,
  "wait_for_output": true
}
```

Fake handle should record inserted text exactly as `df -h\n` and return a known output delta.

Expected red result: unknown tool.

## Task 2: Add Runtime Handler Without UI Dependency

- [x] **Step 1: Define terminal execution trait**

Add a small trait in `public_mcp::registry` or a nearby module:

```rust
pub trait TerminalExecSessionHandle: Send + Sync + 'static {
    fn snapshot(&self) -> TerminalSessionSnapshot;
    fn exec_in_terminal(&self, request: TerminalExecRequest) -> anyhow::Result<TerminalExecResult>;
}
```

Keep this separate from `RemoteOpsSessionHandle` so structured SSH execution and live terminal execution remain distinct.

- [x] **Step 2: Define request/result types**

Use fields from the tool contract:

```rust
pub struct TerminalExecRequest {
    pub target: String,
    pub command: String,
    pub submit: bool,
    pub wait_for_output: bool,
    pub timeout_ms: Option<u64>,
}
```

Result must include completion state and optional exit code.

- [x] **Step 3: Register fake handles in `PublicMcpRegistry`**

Add registry storage and lookup for terminal exec handles. Only expose connected terminal sessions.

- [x] **Step 4: Implement `terminal.exec` runtime tool**

Descriptor:

```text
id = terminal.exec
title = Execute in terminal
read_only = false
open_world = true
risk = High
target = ResourceKind::Terminal required
```

- [x] **Step 5: Run green contract tests**

Run:

```bash
rtk cargo test -p public_mcp --test terminal_exec
```

Expected: contract tests pass.

## Task 3: Wire Terminal View As Provider

- [x] **Step 1: Locate terminal session registration**

Find where `terminal_view::public_mcp::registry(cx)` registers terminal sessions.

- [x] **Step 2: Implement and validate live terminal handle**

The live handle must:

1. Insert command text into the terminal PTY/input buffer.
2. Append Enter when `submit=true`.
3. Return `submitted_only` if reliable output capture is not available yet.
4. Avoid storing GPUI `Entity<Terminal>` inside the public MCP handle.
5. Use a thread-safe input bridge such as `TerminalInputHandle`.

Current implementation note:

1. `TerminalInputHandle` is being added to `crates/terminal/src/types.rs`.
2. `Terminal::external_input_handle()` is being added so `terminal_view` can register
   a provider without crossing GPUI entity/thread boundaries.
3. Local PTY, SSH, and serial backends should forward the handle to their existing
   input/write command channel.
4. `ThreadSafeTerminalExecHandle` in `crates/terminal_view/src/public_mcp.rs` should
   write `command` bytes and append `\n` when `submit=true`.

- [x] **Step 3: Add targeted fake/contract tests**

Use fake terminal components if available. Do not require a real SSH server or GUI window for unit tests.

Required tests for this checkpoint:

```bash
rtk cargo test -p terminal terminal_input_handle_forwards_bytes_to_writer
rtk cargo test -p terminal_view terminal_exec_handle_writes_command_to_terminal_input
rtk cargo test -p public_mcp --test terminal_exec
```

## Task 4: Agent/UI Integration

- [x] **Step 1: Prompt/resource language**

Update Agent prompt rules:

1. Use `terminal.exec` when user asks to execute in the visible terminal.
2. Use `ssh.exec` for structured background/non-interactive command execution.
3. Never claim a `terminal.exec` result has an exit code unless the result contains one.

- [x] **Step 2: Tool cards**

Display:

```text
terminal.exec
target: <terminal label>
command: <exact command>
completion: <state>
```

If output exists, show terminal-style monospace output in the tool card.

- [x] **Step 3: Approval details**

Approval card must show the exact command and target terminal before writing into the live terminal.

## Task 5: Verification

- [x] **Step 1: Provider checkpoint tests**

Run:

```bash
rtk cargo test -p terminal terminal_input_handle_forwards_bytes_to_writer
rtk cargo test -p terminal_view terminal_exec_handle_writes_command_to_terminal_input
rtk cargo test -p public_mcp --test terminal_exec
```

Expected: all targeted provider and contract tests pass.

- [x] **Step 2: Runtime regression tests**

Run:

```bash
rtk cargo test -p public_mcp
rtk cargo test -p main public_mcp_runtime
```

Expected: existing Public MCP runtime behavior remains compatible.

- [x] **Step 3: Compile checks**

Run:

```bash
rtk cargo check -p terminal
rtk cargo check -p terminal_view
rtk cargo check -p public_mcp
rtk cargo check -p main
```

Expected: no new compile errors. Existing unrelated warnings may remain, but must be
called out in the handoff.

- [x] **Step 4: Agent/UI verification after UI wiring**

Run after Task 4 starts:

```bash
rtk cargo test -p agent_runtime
rtk cargo check -p ai_chat_view
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Manual smoke after UI wiring**

Scenario:

1. Open an SSH terminal tab.
2. Ask Agent to run `df -h` in the terminal.
3. Verify the command appears in the terminal pane.
4. Verify terminal output appears in that same pane.
5. Verify Agent tool card says `terminal.exec` and shows the same command/output summary.

## Acceptance Matrix

| Requirement | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Add `terminal.exec` without removing old tools | Done | `f0777d07` adds the runtime contract; old SSH tool ids remain. |
| Public MCP/runtime descriptor exists | Done | `rtk cargo test -p public_mcp --test terminal_exec` passed before `f0777d07`. |
| Live terminal input path is used | Done | `TerminalInputHandle` forwards bytes to backend input channels; `terminal_view` provider test verifies `df -h\n` is written. |
| Terminal output/exit code are not fabricated | Done | Provider returns `submitted_only`, `exit_code: None`, and empty output until reliable capture exists. |
| Agent chooses `terminal.exec` for visible terminal requests | Done | Prompt test verifies visible terminal requests are guided to `terminal_exec` and structured SSH to `ssh_exec`. |
| Tool/approval card labels terminal execution clearly | Done | Card title test verifies `terminal_exec` confirmation cards render as terminal execution. |
| Manual smoke proves command appears in terminal pane | Not started | Requires runnable app smoke after provider and UI wiring. |

## Handoff Notes

1. Treat `terminal.exec` as a live terminal mutation tool. It is high-risk/open-world
   even for commands that look read-only, because it writes into an operator-visible
   session.
2. Keep `ssh.exec` and `ssh.remote_exec` unchanged for structured non-interactive
   execution and compatibility.
3. Until terminal output capture is reliable, the correct result is `submitted_only`
   with no exit code.
4. Commit provider wiring before starting Agent/UI prompt changes. This keeps failures
   easy to bisect.

## Out Of Scope

1. Removing `ssh.exec`.
2. Removing `ssh.remote_exec`.
3. Replacing structured command output with terminal-only output.
4. Multi-terminal fan-out execution.
5. Reliable exit code support when shell integration is unavailable.

## Plan Self-Review

Spec coverage:

1. Adds a new tool instead of mutating existing SSH tools.
2. Preserves previous tools and aliases.
3. Tracks the terminal execution effect requested by the user.
4. Separates structured SSH command execution from live terminal execution.

Marker scan:

1. No placeholder tasks remain.
2. Risky unknowns are explicit and bounded by result states.

Type consistency:

1. `terminal.exec` targets `ResourceKind::Terminal`.
2. `ssh.exec` remains the structured SSH command tool.
3. `TerminalExecSessionHandle` is separate from `RemoteOpsSessionHandle`.
